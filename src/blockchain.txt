create message to other nodes using this function:

signature = func(private_key,message)

other nodes use signature to verify the message came from you using this function:

verify = func(signature,public_key,message)



-------------
nobody can tamper with this system because CHANGES IN THE MESSAGE WOULD INVALIDATE THE SIGNATURE
